# docfu

A document generation utility. The intention is to make writing documentation // books less lame.

On centos the following libraries need be installed:

    texlive-latex texlive-xetex liberation pandoc
    liberation-fonts-mono-fonts liberation-fonts-serif-fonts
    liberation-fonts-common

## Contributing to docfu
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

## Special Thanks

This library was heavily based from (with permission) the skeleton that Scott Chacon used for the book Pro Git.

If you haven't checked it out, you should pick up a [copy](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon/dp/1430218339)!
